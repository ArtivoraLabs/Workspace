   DashView — AI Assistant API configuration
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This is the ONLY file you need to edit to connect the AI Assistant
   (ai.html) to a real language model instead of the local, offline demo
   engine (js/ai-engine.js).

   HOW TO USE:
   1. Get an API key from your model provider (e.g. an Anthropic API key
      from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
   2. Paste it into `apiKey` below.
   3. Save this file and reload ai.html — that's it, nothing else changes.

   Leave `apiKey` empty to keep using the free, fully offline demo engine.
   Both modes work; nothing else in the app breaks either way.

   SECURITY NOTE: this is a static, no-backend site. If you paste a real key
   here, it ships to anyone who loads this file in their browser and is
   sent directly from the browser to `apiUrl` on every message. That's fine
   for local/personal use or a private deployment behind auth, but do not
   publish this file publicly with a real key inside it. For a public
   deployment, proxy requests through the included server/ (Node/Express)
   backend instead, and keep the key server-side there.
