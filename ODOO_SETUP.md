# Odoo connectivity — what was wrong, and how it's fixed

## Root causes found

1. **"Odoo" nav tab was a hardcoded mock** (`js/odoo-service.js`). Its
   "Connect" button never talked to Odoo — it just saved your form values
   to `localStorage` and always returned success, then showed 6-8 fake
   sample rows regardless of what you typed. This is why it looked
   "connected" with no real data — it was never wired to your database.
2. **The real integration (`Odoo (Live)` tab) needs its own backend**
   (`/server`), and that backend was missing a `.env` file. Without
   `JWT_SECRET`, sign-in/register on the DashView API crashes, so the
   Live view could never authenticate and pull real Odoo data even if
   your Odoo credentials were correct.

## What changed

- `server/.env` — created with a generated `JWT_SECRET`, works out of the
  box for local dev. `server/.env.example` documents every variable.
- `.gitignore` — added so `.env` and the local SQLite DB never get
  committed.
- Nav labels — the real integration is now the primary **"Odoo"** link
  (badge: Live). A later update removed the separate demo-data tab
  entirely (there is no mock/sample dataset anywhere in the app now) and
  reworked "Odoo" into a module picker — see `CHANGELOG.md` for that
  change and the current architecture (it talks to Odoo through
  `cloudflare-worker.js`, not the `server/` backend described below).
- **Executive breakdown card** added to the Live Odoo view — pick a
  "Group by" field (e.g. Stage, Salesperson) and a measure (count, or sum
  of a monetary/numeric field) and it renders live totals computed
  server-side via Odoo's `read_group` — the CEO/director-facing
  aggregate view, not raw rows. New endpoint: `POST /api/odoo/read-group`.
- **Connectivity checkpoints panel** (`js/odoo-connectivity.js`) — the
  points most likely to break a real Odoo connection are now surfaced
  directly in the UI instead of failing silently, in two places:
  - **Settings → Odoo integration** — the full checklist: three items
    verified live in the browser (credentials saved, DashView API
    backend reachable, signed-in session), plus a production/
    director-scale checklist (API key vs. password, network path to
    Odoo's `/jsonrpc` endpoint, per-model access rights, `CORS_ORIGIN`
    locked down, server-side role gate on `/api/odoo/*`, read-only API
    user, SQLite→Postgres scaling) that must be confirmed server-side —
    each marked **critical / required / recommended**.
  - **Live Odoo view** — a compact strip of the same three live checks
    at the top of the page, with a "View full checklist" toggle to
    expand the production checklist inline.
  These can't all be verified from client-side JS (server config, Odoo
  permissions, firewall rules), so rather than guessing, each item is
  labelled with its severity and what to go confirm, and where it's
  safe to check, it re-evaluates automatically whenever the Odoo config,
  connection status, or DashView sign-in state changes.

## Run it locally

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start          # http://localhost:4000 — DashView API + Odoo proxy
```

Open the frontend (e.g. `index.html` / `dashboard.html`) in a static
server or your usual dev setup. Then:

1. Go to **Settings** → fill in Odoo URL, Database, Username/email, and
   an **API key** (Odoo → Settings → Users → your user → Account Security
   → New API Key — not your login password).
2. Go to the **Odoo** (Live) tab → sign in / create a DashView account
   inline when prompted → it will pull installed modules, models, fields,
   and records live from your Odoo instance.
3. Use the **Executive breakdown** panel at the top of the model view for
   grouped totals.

## Going to production (CEO/director-scale deployment)

- Host `server/` somewhere real (Render, Railway, a VPS/Docker) with
  HTTPS, not `localhost`.
- Set `CORS_ORIGIN` in `.env` to your exact frontend domain — never `*`
  once real Odoo credentials are flowing through it.
- Use a **dedicated read-only Odoo API user** for the dashboard rather
  than an admin account, especially for models with sensitive data
  (HR, payroll, financials).
- If multiple directors will query heavy reports concurrently, move off
  SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) to Postgres, and consider caching frequent
  `read_group` aggregates (e.g. a 15-minute scheduled sync) so dashboards
  load instantly instead of hitting Odoo on every page view.
- Add a server-side role check in `server/src/middleware/auth.js` so only
  Admin/Owner roles can call the `/api/odoo/*` routes that carry Odoo
  credentials (client-side gating exists today; the comment in
  `odoo.routes.js` already flags this as a pre-production TODO).


## The AI shows no Odoo data — checklist

1. In **ai.html** type `status`. It prints the exact failing stage:
   - `config` → a field is empty. With a workspace passcode the API key lives only in memory: unlock, or re-enter the key in Settings → Odoo and press Connect.
   - `proxy` / `reach` → Worker URL wrong or not deployed, or `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` / `ALLOWED_ODOO_HOSTS` don't match.
   - `login` → Database must be the subdomain (name.odoo.com → `name`), login email, fresh API key.
   - table row "no access" → give the API user that app's rights in Odoo; "not installed" → ignore or install.
2. **No AI key?** Settings → AI Assistant → pick Groq/Grok/Claude and paste the key. Without one only the offline engine runs, and it cannot read Odoo.
3. Redeploy `cloudflare-worker.js` (Cloudflare → Worker → Edit code → paste → Deploy) to enable `diagnose` and `batch`; then hard-refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) so the new service worker cache loads.
4. Same check from a terminal: `node scripts/odoo-check.mjs` (see the header of that file).
